Simple klog app - this can be used to gather data from anywhere in the
kernel without needing to write any relay code (just put klog() and
klog_printk() calls wherever you want).

* Kernel Preparing:
1. Apply klog.patch to kernel.
1.5 cp include/klog.h to kernel's include/linux/
2. Compile klog-mod.c into kernel, or as a module and insert into it.
3. Enable kernel configuration CONFIG_KLOG in "make menuconfig -> kernel hacking" 
4. Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_FS or CONFIG_RELAY is necessary.
5. Boot kernel and mount debugfs to /mnt/relay by running automatically or by hand:

#mount -t debugfs debugfs /mnt/relay

* User program preparing:

1. Cross compile klog.c and copy the binary to target root fs

Then:

1. Include <linux/klog.h>, log whatever data you want from the kernel or
   modules using klog() and/or klog_printk().

2. Run klog to take the log.
